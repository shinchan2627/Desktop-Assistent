# Personal Assistant

The Personal Assistant is a Python-based application that acts as a virtual assistant, capable of performing various tasks and providing helpful information. It utilizes voice recognition, text-to-speech synthesis, and integration with external services to offer a range of functionalities.

## Features
The main features of this personal assistant include:

Voice Interaction: Users can communicate with the assistant using voice commands, making it convenient and hands-free.
Speech Recognition: The assistant utilizes the SpeechRecognition library to recognize user input and convert it into text.
Text-to-Speech: The pyttsx3 library is used for text-to-speech synthesis, allowing the assistant to respond audibly to user queries.
Wikipedia Integration: The assistant can search for information on specific topics using the Wikipedia API.
Reminder System: Users can set reminders by specifying the time and message, and the assistant will notify them at the scheduled time.
Web Browser Integration: The assistant can open popular websites like YouTube and Google in the default web browser.
Error Handling: The assistant handles unknown commands and provides appropriate feedback to the user.
To use the assistant, simply run the script and follow the prompts. You can choose to use the microphone for voice input or enter commands manually. The assistant will respond accordingly based on the recognized command.

Note: This code requires additional libraries such as SpeechRecognition, pyttsx3, keyboard, datetime, time, shutil, os, webbrowser, and wikipediaapi. Make sure to install these libraries using pip before running the code.
